.SH "NAME"
\fBpspg\fR \- Postgres Pager
.P
Everybody who uses \fBpsql\fR also uses the \fBless\fR pager\. Which, while it works well, has no special support for tabular data\. I found a few projects, but none was good enough for this purpose\. Thus I decided to write a small specialized pager to use as a \fBpsql\fR pager\.
.P
This pager can be used from the following command line clients, too:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBmysql\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBsqlite\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBpgcli\fR \fIhttps://github\.com/dbcli/pgcli/\fR

.IP "\(bu" 4
mouse is supported and used
.IP "\(bu" 4
ability to copy a selected range to the clipboard

.SH "Installation and basic configuration"
The \fBpspg\fR can be simply installed from Debian (Ubuntu) repositories\. RedHat (Fedora) repositories contains \fBpspg\fR too:
.IP "" 4
.nf
# Debian (Ubuntu)
sudo apt\-get install pspg

# RedHat (Fedora)
sudo dnf install pspg
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
Basic configuration is very simple \- just set system environment variable \fBPSQL_PAGER\fR:
.IP "" 4
.nf
export PSQL_PAGER='pspg'
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
or with some common options (\fB\-b\fR means blackwhite theme, \fB\-X\fR preserve content after exit):
.IP "" 4
.nf
export PSQL_PAGER='pspg \-X \-b'
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
Attention: options used in command line has higher priority than options specified in configuration file (\fB~/\.pspgconf\fR)\.
.P
Native installation on MS Windows is not supported, but \fBpspg\fR works well inside \fBwsl2\fR\. Inside wsl2 environment, the installation is same like on used Linux system\.
.P
Installation on macOS/homebrew is simple by \fBbrew install pspg\fR\.

Options can also be passed within the \fBPSPG\fR environment variable\. Configuration file is processed first\. Options from the \fBPSPG\fR variable are processed afterwards step and command line options are processed at the end\. One option can be processed multiple times, the last value wins\.

The interval between pressing \fBEsc\fR and \fBkey\fR is limited by interval specified by option \fBesc\-delay\fR or by configuration's option \fBesc_delay\fR\. This is max delay time in ms\.

Column search is case insensitive every time\. Searched column is marked by vertical cursor\. Last non empty string searching pattern is used when current searching pattern is empty string\. Searching is starting after visible vertical column or on first visible not freezed columns (after some horizontal scrolling) or on first column\. After last column searching starts from first again\.

When you use \fBpspg\fR on Cygwin, then some temporary freezing of scrolling was reported In this case, please, use an option \fB\-\-no\-sleep\fR\. I see slow scrolling (via scrollbar) inside konsole (KDE terminal)\. The option \fB\-\-no\-sleep\fR helps too\.

The result of query can be refreshed every n seconds\. \fBpspg\fR remembers cursor row, possible vertical cursor, possible ordering\. The refreshing should be paused by pressing \fBspace\fR key\. Repeated pressing of this key enables refreshing again\.

\fBpspg\fR uses inotify API when it is available, and when input file is changed, then \fBpspg\fR reread file immediately\. This behave can be disabled by option \fB\-\-no\-watch\-file\fR or by specification watch time by option \fB\-\-watch\fR\.
.SH "Streaming modes"
\fBpspg\fR can read a continuous stream of tabular data from pipe, named pipe or from file (with an option \fB\-\-stream\fR or it can read a stream of queries from pipe or from file (with an option \fB\-\-querystream\fR)\. In stream mode, only data in table format can be processed, because \fBpspg\fR uses empty line as separator between tables\.
.P
The query stream mode is an sequence of SQL statements separated by char GS (Group separator \- 0x1D on separated line\.

Older version of pgcli had very slow output in tabular format\. An workaround was using csv format\. This should not be necessary on current versions when the performance issue was fixed\.

.SH "Note \- true color themes on KDE konsole terminal"
On my Fedora this terminal doesn't correctly display true color themes\. The basic problem is in default \fBTERM\fR setting, that is \fBxterm\-256color\fR\. Unfortunately, the \fBkonsole\fR terminal is not fully compatible with \fBxterm\fR, and doesn't allow color changing\. You can force direct colors by using the option \fB\-\-direct\-color\fR or by setting \fBTERM=xterm\-direct\fR\. Second option is more correct setting of \fBTERM\fR variable to \fBkonsole\-256color\fR\. In this case the \fBpspg\fR will map the true rgb colors to supported 256 colors\.

If you want to use \fBpspg\fR as Postgres client, then you need run \fBconfigure \-\-with\-postgresql=yes\fR\. On Fedora with own Postgres build I had to install \fBopenssl\-devel\fR package and I had to set \fBexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/pgsql/master/lib/pkgconfig/"\fR\.

If you would to display UTF\-8 characters, then \fBpspg\fR should be linked with \fBncursesw\fR library\. UTF\-8 characters are displayed badly when library \fBncursesw\fR is used\. You can see broken characters with incorrect locale setting too\.
.P
You can check wide chars support by \fBpspg \-\-version\fR\. Row \fBncurses with wide char support\fR is expected\. Re\-run \fBconfigure\fR with \fB\-\-with\-ncursesw\fR option\. When this command fails check if development package for ncursesw library is installed\.

there is not any difference from installation and work on Ubuntu (Debian)
.P
\fBpspg\fR is not ported to MS Windows yet\. There is the dependency on ncurses and correctly (fully) implemented function \fBnewterm\fR (\fBpdcurses\fR does this only on Unix platforms)\. It can work with WSL2 maybe (I didn't test it)\. An alternative can be using \fBless\fR pager, that is ported to some MS Win enviroments\. \fBless\fR depends on \fBtermcap\fR, and it is little bit more portable than \fBpspg\fR (\fBtermcal\fR is low layer of ncurses)\. \fBless\fR supports fixed rows and with \fB\-\-chop\-long\-lines\fR option or just \fB\-S\fR can be used as pager for \fBpspg\fR\.

.SS "Solaris"
There are few issues requires manual code changes for successful compilation \- we successfully tested \fBpspg\fR, but although \fBpspg\fR was linked with ncursesw libraries, the utf8 encoding support didn't work fully correctly \- probably due some issues in \fBlibc\fR library\. There are problems with chars encoded to 3bytes \- unicode borders, \.\. Two bytes unicode chars should be displayed well\.
.P
You can use \fBpspg\fR with usual accented chars, but unicode borders should not be used\. Replacement ascii borders by special borders chars (by ncurses technology) works well \- looks on \fBOptions|Force unicode borders\fR option\.

Replace printing document directly to ncurses window by some smarter structure\. Internally there are lot of checks and fixes to support complex dynamic layout\.
